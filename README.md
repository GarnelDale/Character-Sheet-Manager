# Overview
This program is a very basic Character Sheet helper and die manager for a tabletop role playing game. Currently, all player information needs to be entered at runtime.

I started this project to learn basics of Python from the input/output stream through class definitions and inheritance. I
felt it would be very helpful to me as a dungeon master who often does not have a personal character sheet on hand to have a program that can quickly be filled to cleanly portray my characters for use as a player. Additionally, I designed it with the intent to one day expand for use as a DM for storage of enemy or NPC stat blocks.

# Future Work
* File save and load capabilities so the Character sheet information only needs input once, rather than once per program
* Fully flesh out Character sheet information (stats, spell lists, equipment, feats and skills, etc.)
* Design dynamic object management for enemy and NPC stat block creation, update, display, and deletion
